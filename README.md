# A-Comprehensive-Exploration-of-Multivariate-Statistical-Learning-Dimensionality-and-Boosting
This repository is a unified collection of advanced assignments and research-oriented simulations exploring multivariate statistical learning, boosting algorithms, and optimization methods.
It bridges theory and computation across core machine-learning concepts such as Bayes classification, cross-validation, PCA (and its sparse/kernel variants), Matching Pursuit, Gradient Boosting, and penalized optimization.

The experiments are derived from exercises in multivariate analysis, machine learning, and statistical learning texts, extended with modern Python implementations, simulation results, and visualizations.
